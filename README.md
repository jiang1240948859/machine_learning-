### packages and modules used
numpy,pandas,matplotlib,sklearn,xgboost,Geohash

### usage

The three python scripts use different models to model the data. ` RF.py `uses random forest to model the ` train.csv `,while the ` gbdt.py ` and 
` gbdt_geohash.py ` use xgboost model, while the latter one entails more complex characteristic making.
